# credit-risk-classification

The primary goal of this challenge was to train and evaluate the regression model to predict the credibility of borrowers from a bank. Using historical dataset of lending activities from burrowers, the challenge was aimed to build a logistic regression model to classify risk loan. The analysis involved two datapoints, the “healthy loan” and the “high-risk loan”, through the regression model, and evaluating the performance, an analysis can be made on the accuracy of the model.
Results:

**Accuracy**: The model’s accuracy score was computed by comparing the prediction on the test set with the labels.

Healthy Loans:
  -Precision: 1.00
  -Recall: 1.00
  -F1-score: 1.00
  -Support: 18,759 instances
  
High-Risk Loans:
  -Precision: 0.87
  -Recall: 0.89
  -F1-score: 0.88
  -Support: 625 instances
Overall Accuracy: The model achieved an accuracy of 99% across all instances in the test set.
Macro Average:
  -Precision: 0.94
  -Recall: 0.94
  -F1-score: 0.94
Weighted Average:
  -Precision: 0.99
  -Recall: 0.99
  -F1-score: 0.99

  
**Precision**: The precision score was calculated for both classes to determine the models ability to correctly classify each class.


**Recall**: The recall score was also calculated for both classes to assess how well the model captures all the instances of each class.
